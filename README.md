# End-to-End Machine Learning Project 

> 📌 Machine Learning Project (coursework-inspired) demonstrating a complete end-to-end ML pipeline using industry-standard practices.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline**, covering every stage of the ML lifecycle — from raw data ingestion to model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness. The focus is on building a practical, real-world ML system using clean architecture and best practices.

## 📚 Project Origin & Attribution
